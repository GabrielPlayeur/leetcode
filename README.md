# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized according to the NeetCode roadmap. The structure is designed to help track progress, review algorithms and data structures used, and reflect on challenges encountered during problem solving.

## Repository Structure

- **Category Folders** (e.g., `arrays`, `stack`, `twoPointers`):
  - Each category is divided by difficulty: `easy`, `medium`, `hard`.
  - Each difficulty folder contains Python files for individual LeetCode problems.
  - Each category folder contains a `README.md` listing the main data structures and algorithms used for that topic.

- **Badges Folder**: Contains daily challenge solutions, organized by Leetcode.

- **Explanation Files**: Each difficulty folder contains a `README.md` explaining the challenges faced and providing additional explanations for selected problems.

## How to Use

- Browse by category and difficulty to find solutions.
- Refer to the `README.md` in each category for an overview of key concepts.
- Check the `README.md` in each difficulty folder for insights and explanations about specific problems.

## Example Structure

```
arrays/
  easy/
    1.py
    217.py
    ...
    README.md  # Explanations and challenges for easy problems
  medium/
    128.py
    ...
    README.md  # Explanations and challenges for medium problems
  README.md    # List of data structures and algorithms used in arrays
stack/
  ...
```

## Why This Structure?

This organization mirrors the NeetCode roadmap, making it easier to follow a structured learning path and review progress. The additional markdown files help document learning, challenges, and key takeaways for future reference.
