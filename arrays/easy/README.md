# Easy Array Problems

This folder contains easy-level array problems. 

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding the problem statement precisely.
- Identifying the most efficient approach (brute force vs. optimized).
- Handling edge cases such as empty arrays or single-element arrays.

## Explanations
- For each problem, comments in the code explain the logic and approach.
- When a problem required a specific algorithm (e.g., hash table for duplicates), a brief explanation is provided in the code.

Refer to the code files for detailed solutions and comments.
